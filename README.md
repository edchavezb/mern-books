# Book RecomMERNdations

This simple MERN app allows visitors to search for a book title and add it to a collective list of the best books ever written. Users can later review the list and delete titles, if they authenticate with the right permissions. The app uses the Google Books API to retrieve and display information about each title.


## Built with

* React (Frontend framework)
* Express (API and server)
* MongoDB (Database)
* Bootstrap (Grid, spacing, nav and button styling)
* Google Books API (For book details and front cover)


## Usage

Use the search box to enter the name of a book you consider excellent. From the results you can find the right book and save it to our collective list. Review the list by clicking on "Saved".
